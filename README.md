- Round and smooth intersections
- Intelligent and easy drawing
- Support elevated road and 3D objects on road side
- Input validity check

## Traffic Simulation
- Navigation from source to sink with auto lane selection
- Longitudinal and lane-changing behavior based on IDM and BOMIL models

## Major Todos
- Optimize vehicle simulation efficiency
- Configuration panel for each road and crossroads
- Handle lane-changing deadlocks
